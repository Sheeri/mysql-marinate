1. When would you use a weak entity?


2. Is it better to use entities instead of attributes?


3. Alter and extend the music database ER model so that it can store 
compilations, where a compilation is an album that contains tracks by two 
or more different artists. Explain what you changed and why.

4. Create an ER diagram for an online media store and explain your choices (e.g. why did you make X an entity and Y a relationship) using the following requirements:
 - There are two types of product: music CDs and video DVDs.
 - Customers can buy any number of each product.
 - For each CD, store the title, the artist’s name, the label (publisher), 
   and the price. Also store the number, title, and length (in seconds) 
   of each track on the CD.
 - For each video DVD, store the title the studio name, and the price.

Tables 4-1 and 4-2 contain some sample data to help you better understand 
the requirements.

If you are using Visio, Mike Murphy points out that there is a stencil by 
Daniel Harris that worked for him at 
http://www.visiocafe.com/downloads/various/DanielHarris/Chen_ER.zip

This directory also contains a Diagram4_11.odg file with Diagram 4-11, for use in question 3, and
as a model for question 4.
The .odg file was created on Open Office, but all compatibile programs can be seen at:
http://www.fileinfo.com/extension/odg

Or you can just hand-draw diagrams for questions 3 and 4 and take a picture, as in the Diagram4_11.jpg file.

DO NOT USE MySQL Workbench for these diagrams. Those are not true E-R diagrams with proper symbols and notation.
